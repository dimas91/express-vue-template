You must at least have **NODE version 8.2.1**

### Client - Terminal A

npm install
npm start

# Usage

There are two simple example pages in this template, namely at /register and /test. The button on the /register page will show how a POST API call can be made to the server that returns an object that can be displayed. The button on the /test page will show the same functionality for a GET request.
